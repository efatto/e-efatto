This module automates the delivery price handling for the following cases:

* If you change any line in your draft sales order (SO), when saving, the
  delivery price will be adjusted without having to click on "â†’ Set price".
* If specified in the system parameter, the delivery line can be also
  auto-added when creating/saving.
